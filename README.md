# GHANA-S-FOREST-TRAJECTORY-1990-2020
Global forest; a closer look at Ghana's forest from 1990 to 2020
The global forestry landscape is a mosaic of diverse ecosystems, each contributing uniquely to our planet’s health and biodiversity. 
Zooming in on Ghana’s forests, we see a rich tapestry of flora and fauna that not only supports local communities but also plays a crucial role in the global environment. 
Ghana’s forests, like those in many other countries, are invaluable for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and cultural significance.
However, the urgent need for sustainable practices and global cooperation to combat deforestation cannot be overstated. 
Deforestation poses a significant threat to these vital ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity, disruption of water cycles, and increased carbon emissions.
